# Description
Github is a very important tool for managing code in an organization. Having a shared organizational codebase ensures access for members of a community so that intellectual property can be shared, managed, and transitioned through employee turnover. Companies that fail to use code control face serious problems with theft, hacking, etc. Thus, we learn how to use repos and manage them at a basic level in our class.
